This repo combines both the first half, Unity 1-4, within SampleScene and all "Book" named folders,
with the independent Frogger game being in the "LeapFrog" scene and all "Frog" named folders


Unity 5 README:

Changes made to the game: I have the idea to have 1 player be faster at moving but slower at rotating, 
while 1 player is slower to move, but faster at rotating, so that way there are 2 different skillsets
that a player can use depending on which player they play. For future changes outside of course 
requirements, I want to add a split-screen camera and fine-tune the player movement more.

Unity 6 README:

Added text boxes that displayed score, and went away and showed which player won

Unity 7 & 8 README:
Added an inventory system for collectable powerups you can get in a game

additionally, I added a new shooting mechanic for players to stagger the other frog, and added 
split-screen to make the game easier to play for 2 players

for Player 1, it's E to shoot, and for Player 2, it's U to shoot
